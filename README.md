# Wheat Genotypic Performance Under Variable Nitrogen Fertilization

A statistical analysis project investigating the effects of nitrogen application rates on winter wheat yield across 10 genotypes and two South Dakota locations.

## Project Overview
- **Course**: STAT 541 – Statistical Methods II  
- **University**: South Dakota State University  
- **Team**: Amool Singh Vadithya, Ashish Chaudhary, Horender Sharma, Shivam Singh  
- **Instructor**: Dr. Gemechis Djira  
- **Semester**: Fall 2025  

## Objectives
To evaluate genotype × nitrogen × location interactions and identify high-performing, stable wheat genotypes for optimal nitrogen management.

## Methods
- **Experimental Design**: Split-plot RCBD  
- **Statistical Model**: Linear Mixed Model (LMM) with `lme4` in R  
- **Key Analyses**: ANOVA, post-hoc comparisons, interaction plots, correlation matrices  

## Key Findings
- WW7 and WW6 showed high yield stability across locations.
- Nitrogen response was location-dependent.
- Genotype was the only significant factor affecting yield in the final model.
